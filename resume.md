Abstract
--------

*   I'm a master degree IT professional mainly focused on software engineering with a deep
background in backend systems, operations and automation, being interested also in distributed systems,
scalable databases and open source software. I enjoy clean, documented and tested
code, and keep reading and learning about new technologies. I'm passionate about
what I do and can work readily either alone or within a team, having wide experience working
remotely within a distributed team. I don't fear of talking in public or taking responsibilities,
as I consider myself to have good leadership skills. I'm also able to provide advanced technical
support and mentorship.
